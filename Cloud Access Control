##Cloud Access Control
How would you control access to a cloud network?


Restate the Problem


Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

- In Project 1, did you deploy an on-premises or cloud network?
- Did you have to configure access controls to this network?
- What kinds of access controls did you configure, and why were they necessary?
- How do these details relate to the interview question?



Explain the Solution Requirements


In Project 1, what kinds of access controls did you have to implement? Consider:

- NSGs around the VNet? Around the VMs?
- Local firewalls (ufw, etc.) on each VM?
- Protocol allow/deny lists?



What did each access control achieve, and why was this restriction necessary for the project?




Explain the Solution Details

- Which rules do you set for each NSG in the network?
- How does access to the jump box work?
- How does access from the jump box to the web servers work?



Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

- Does your solution scale?
- Is there a better solution than a jump box?
- What are the disadvantages of implementing a VPN that kept you from doing it this time?
- What are the advantages of a VPN?
- When is it appropriate to use a VPN?
