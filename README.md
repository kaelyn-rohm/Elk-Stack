## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Elk-Diagram](Diagrams/Elk-Diagram.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function         | IP Address | OS    |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------|
| Jump-Box | Gateway          | 10.0.0.4   | Linux |
| Web-1    | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.5   | Linux |
| Web-2    | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.6   | Linux |
| Web-3    | DVWA Containers  | 10.0.0.7   | Linux |
| ELK      | Configuration VM | 10.1.0.4   | Linux |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 23.241.224.203 - My Router IP

Machines within the network can only be accessed by accessing the container in the Jump Box VM.
- The only machines allowed to access the ELK server are 23.241.224.203, my Router IP, and the Jump Box VM at 10.0.0.4 (Private IP) thorugh a peering connection.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes/No              | 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-playbook.yml file to /etc/ansible/roles.
- Update the filebeat-config.yml file to include your ELK servers private IP address in line 1106 and 1806.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to kibana at [ELK public IP]/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.


_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
